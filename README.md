### borg-docker-volume

This is a Bash script to backup a Docker volume's contents using [Borg backup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


##### Requirements

For a Bash script to backup Docker volumes using Borg, I'd be surprised if it had any dependency other than Bash, Docker, and Borg. To install Borg, follow the instructions provided [here](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).

To run this script, you need to be in the list of users who can execute sudo (typically, `wheel`). This is because Docker volumes are read-only to root. See the source code for more comments on where `sudo` is used.

##### Usage

First, create a Borg repository wherever you want your backups to be stored:

```bash
$ borg init --encryption=repokey /path/to/borg/repository
```

You will be prompted for a passphrase. Once you enter that, an encrypted Borg repository will be created at `/path/to/borg/repository`. I strongly recommend encrypting your backups, but if you don't want to, use `--encryption none`, and you won't be prompted for a passphrase. This step may be performed on your local machine or a remote machine with SSH access.

Next, say you have a Docker volume called `sqlite_volume` that you want to backup. Then you'd run this script as follows:

```bash
$ BORG_PASSPHRASE=password borg-docker-volume -b /path/to/borg/repository -v sqlite_volume
```

If your `/path/to/borg/repository` is on a remote server, you can give a remote address such as `user@example.com:/path/to/borg/repository`.

If you're not comfortable entering your password directly (you shouldn't be), you can save it in a file and `source(1)` it. For example, you can create a file called `/etc/borg_passphrase` and give it the desired permissions with the following contents:

```bash
$ cat /etc/borg_passphrase
export BORG_PASSPHRASE=pass
$ source /etc/borg_passphrase
$ borg-docker-volume -b /path/to/borg/repository -v sqlite_volume
```
